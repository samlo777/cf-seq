8/3/21,GSE181354,Differential transcriptome profiling of P. aeruginosa PAO1 with oxythiamine treatment,"We report antibacterial potency of oxythiamine, which is a known transketolase inhibitor in eukaryotes. Oxythiamine inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and clinical isolates in thiamine-depleted medium only. Metabolic and trascriptomic analyses indicated that oxythiamine was converted to oxythiamine pyrophosphate that subsequently inhibited several vitamin B1-dependent enzymes. Furthermore, a system-level perturbation of thiamine metabolism sensitized P. aeruginosa to multiple small-molecules informing the potential development of a rational drug combination.",PAO1,M9 Glucose Media,Oxythiamine,NA,https://www-ncbi-nlm-nih-gov.ezproxy.u-pec.fr/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE181354
